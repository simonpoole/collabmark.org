## Introduction
### Why does OSM have marks?
The OpenStreetMap marks represent OSM and its work to bring open map data to the entire world. When users see the OpenStreetMap name and logo, they should be confident that they are looking at a high quality map that is the result of the rigorous and comprehensive collaboration process of OpenStreetMap. Trademark protection helps reinforces that connection.

### What are the goals of this trademark policy?
The goodwill supporting the OSM marks has been generated by a prolific and passionate volunteer community. The OpenStreetMap Foundation has prepared this policy to preserve and protect that goodwill by ensuring that uses of the marks are consistent with OSM's mission and promote the OSM movement.

### How is this trademark policy different from most trademark policies?
This trademark policy seeks to make trademark licensing as easy as possible for the contributors who created OSM, by making explicit that many uses do not require a trademark license, and by empowering them to use OSM's marks without a trademark license for community-focused events and outreach work. OSMF hopes that this helps spread OSM and encourage contribution while also ensuring that the mark remains a reliable signal of quality.

For more information on how trademark can be useful for open source projects, see [collabmark.org](http://collabmark.org).

## 1. Definitions

### 1.1. The “OSM marks”
The OSM marks are the logos, non-stylized wordmarks, and trade dress of OSM, State of the Map, the OpenStreetMap Foundation, and related projects. Some of the marks are registered and some are not. A non-exclusive list of the OSM marks includes: 
- "OpenStreetMap"
- "OSM" when used in the geo data context
- the OpenStreetMap magnifying glass logo
- "OpenStreetMap Foundation"
- "OSM Foundation"
- "OSMF" `[QQQ: should this also be limited to the geodata context?]`
- "State of the Map"
- "SotM" `[QQQ: should this also be limited to the geodata context?]`
- the logos of the State of the Map conference

### 1.2. "OSMF"
The OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) acts as a steward for the OSM marks. OSMF's stewardship includes registering the OSM's marks, promotion and licensing of the marks, and taking steps to protect the goodwill of the marks when necessary.

### 1.3. “You”
“You” is anyone who wants to use the OSM marks. You may be a community member (as further explained in Sec. 1.3.1) or an unrelated individual or organization (as further explained in Sec. 1.3.2).

#### 1.3.1. Community members
In this policy, "Community members" includes everyone who contributes to an OSM project in order to support OSM's mission. It also includes members and staff of recognized OSM organizations, such as the local chapters and the OSMF.

As detailed in the rest of the policy, Community members are generally free to use all OSM marks for community-focused events, such as outreach work, without a trademark license. Community members can also generally easily get a license for other permitted uses.

#### 1.3.2. Unrelated organizations or individuals
In this policy, "You" may include individuals and companies who are not contributors, but who want to use OSM's data and display OSM's well-known marks in books, apps, or other media. 

As long as consumers of those media are not confused about the source of those works, this type of use can promote OSM and OSM's mission, and potentially recruit new contributors to OSM. However, it is important that the OSM marks are not misleadingly used to market others’ products, because that will confuse users of our project. Therefore, as detailed in the rest of the policy, such use is never allowed without a trademark license. 

### 1.4. “Mission”
OSM's mission is to make the best map data set of the world, available under a free and open license to everybody. For more details, see OSM's [mission statement](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Mission_Statement). 

### 1.5. “OSM projects”
The OSM projects include the OpenStreetMap itself and the underlying database, the OpenStreetMap Foundation, the State of the Map conference, and other related community-supported projects. `[QQQ: Any key activities missing here?]`

## 2. How to use the OSM marks

`[QQQ: LV believes OSM has no visual identity guidelines, or equivalent document on use of the mark. Please let me know if otherwise.]` 

Whenever you use the OSM marks, regardless of why you are allowed to use the marks, you must comply with the requirements in this section.

### 2.1. Proper form

You may:
* use the wordmarks as a proper name (e.g. “OpenStreetMap is great”) or as an adjective (e.g. “the OpenStreetMap projects are awesome”). This includes any official translations and transliterations of the OSM marks.
* use OSM wordmarks in their full form and properly capitalized (e.g. "State of the Map was fun this year").

You may not:
* abbreviate the wordmarks or combine them with other words (e.g. not "OpenStreetMapWorld").
* modify or remix the logos (like the magnifiying glass) without permission from the OSMF.

### 2.2. Required notices
Please include this notice, or something similar, when you use a mark outside of the OSM projects: 

> `[Wordmark / name of logo]` is a trademark of the OpenStreetMap Foundation, and is used with their permission. `[We / this product / this project]` are not endorsed by or affiliated with the OpenStreetMap Foundation.

The notice should appear near the first use of any OSM mark. One notice is enough if you display multiple marks, provided the notice refers to all of them.

If the mark will primarily appear on a mobile screen or another medium with limited visual space, you may instead use a trademark symbol (™) with the mark to show that it is an OSM trademark. When you use a symbol due to limited space and there are additional pages to your material, please include the notice in the text of a prominent page (for example, the "about us" section of a mobile app).

### 2.3. No confusion, endorsement, or affiliation
Your use of the mark must not confuse users by suggesting endorsement by, or affiliation with, the OSMF. Notices such as those in Sec. 2.2 can be used to help you meet this requirement.

## 3. When you may use the OSM marks without asking us

In many cases, you may use the OSM marks without asking for permission from the OSMF. This section lists those cases. Uses that are not allowed under this Section require a trademark license, discussed in more detail in Section 4.

### 3.1. Community-focused events
You may use the OSM marks for events that promote OSM's mission and are intended to be predominantly attended by community members, like [mapathons](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mapathon). For example, you may put the OSM logo on banners and posters to promote a mapathon you've organized. 

### 3.2. Outreach and recruiting new contributors 
You may use the OSM marks to educate people about OSM and to recruit new contributors, as long as you make it clear that you do not work for OSMF. Things we encourage you to do include creating marketing materials, educational material, or materials to decorate a public fair stand or to publicize an event. But, please don’t sell any of them. 

### 3.3. Discussing something other than OSM projects (fair use)
"Open", "Street", and "Map" have their own meanings, in addition to representing OSM's brand when combined. Where these words are used to talk about something other than the OSM projects, OSMF will interpret fair use broadly, in order to protect free speech. `[QQQ: I'm not sure this makes sense in the OSM context - should consider removing section altogether.]` 

### 3.4. Refer to OSM projects (nominative use)
You may use the non-stylized wordmarks (such as "OpenStreetMap") to factually name or refer to:
 - An OSM project or another aspect of the movement in a text (for example, "I love seeing my town on OpenStreetMap").
 - A project derived from an OSM project in a way that is factual and not misleading (for example, "This company's maps are based on OpenStreetMap", as long as it is accurate that the maps are in fact based on OSM data).

Here are some specific examples of nominative use:

#### 3.4.1. News reporting
You may use the OSM marks to make truthful statements about OSM in news reports and commentary.

#### 3.4.2. Personal blogs and social media
You may use the OSM marks to make truthful statements about OSM in personal blogs and social media. 

But please don’t imply endorsement by, or affiliation with, the OSMF. To avoid confusion, don’t use OSM logos in the background, as your profile image, or in the header of your blog. If you use the OSM name in a social media name (like "@ILoveOpenStreetMap") make clear in the network's "about" or "bio" field that the account is not official and is not endorsed by OSMF.

#### 3.4.3. Artistic, scientific, literary, political, and other non-commercial uses 
You may use the OSM marks to discuss and comment on the OSM projects in artistic, scientific, literary, and political work. 

But please send us a request if you want to place an OSM mark on the cover of your book, display an OSM mark in a movie, or organize an event or presentation that could appear to be endorsed by OSMF. For more information, please see the portion of this policy on “special uses that require permission” (Section 4).

You may also use the marks in satire or jokes. To avoid confusing users about your work's affiliation with OSM projects, it may be helpful to mark your work as “satire” or “parody.”

#### 3.4.4. Links to OSM projects

You may use the OSM marks on your own website to identify a hyperlink to the OSM projects. If you are using the logo, though, do not modify the logo except to resize it.

#### 3.4.5. Compliance with attribution requirements
You may use the OSM wordmarks as necessary to comply with the attribution requirements imposed by the OSM project's database and copyright licensing terms. For more information on OSM's database and copyright license, and how to credit us, see [the OSM website](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright).

### 3.5. Make your own branded stuff
You may create things with the marks for your own use. These can be t-shirts, caps, desktop wallpapers, and even cakes! But please don’t sell them. 

If you want to _sell_ your stuff with OSM's brand on it, you may request a license under Section 4.4.

## 4. Special uses that require permission

All uses that are not allowed under Section 3 or prohibited by Section 5 of this policy require a trademark license. This section discusses only the most common uses that require a license.

To contact the OSMF to get a license for one of these uses, email legal@osmfoundation.org with subject "Trademark Use Request" and the information requested below in the relevant section.

When you use OSM's marks under a trademark license, you need to comply with the terms of that license as well as with this trademark policy. If a term in another license is inconsistent with this policy, you must follow the terms of that license. 

### 4.1. Domain names
You need a trademark license to register or use a domain name that contains an OSM mark. Please don’t register a domain that looks or sounds similar to an OSM mark, or includes a misspelled OSM mark, as that can confuse OSM users.

As an exception to this requirement, you may use an OSM mark in a subdomain (such as openstreetmap.service.com) if the service hosted at that domain is based on OpenStreetMap, and other requirements of this policy (such as Section 2) are complied with.

### 4.2. Events and conferences
You need a trademark license if you plan to host a public event or a conference that uses an OSM mark. 

You should include the following information when requesting a license to use OSM's marks in an event:                                                                                                  
1. What is the proposed title of the event?
2. Who is hosting, sponsoring, or coordinating the event? 
3. Include contact information (and OSM account name if relevant) for the person organizing the event.
4. Is the event organized for community members?
5. What is the topic of the event?
6. The location, date, and duration of the event.
7. Include handouts, examples, mockups, or other descriptions of the proposed use.

When you get a trademark license, it will only apply to the specific event in your request. You will need to apply for a new license if you want to host another event. 

### 4.3. Publications
You need a trademark license if you want to use an OSM mark in a publication in a way that is not fair or nominative use under U.S. trademark law or other applicable foreign laws, such as a book cover that might imply endorsement of your book by the OSMF.

You should include the following information when requesting a license to use our marks in a publication.                                                                                                  
 1. What is the proposed title of the publication?
 2. Contact information (and OSM account name if relevant) for the applicant.
 3. Who is the author, editor, and publisher of the publication?
 4. How do you want to use and discuss the mark?
 5. Include printouts of the pages in your publication that includes or discusses the mark. (For a book, where in the book will the mark appear?)
 6. If your publication will display a screenshot of an OSM project, please include that as well. 
 7. Will the publication be in hard copy, an e-book, or some other type of medium? 
 8. What is the print run and distribution area for the publication? How many editions will it have?

When you get a trademark license, it will only apply to the specific publication in your request. You will need to apply for a new license if you want to make another publication. 

### 4.4. Commercial merchandise 
You need a trademark license if you want to make merchandise with the OSM marks for commercial use. All such licenses will require, at least, that you:
* use OSM's logos without modifying them; and
* truthfully advertise to customers how much of the selling price, if any, will be donated to OSM projects.

## 5. Prohibited uses

Some uses of the marks are never permitted. This section discusses the most common examples of such prohibited uses.

### 5.1. Mimicking OSM sites
Please don’t create a website that mimics the 'look and feel' of an OSM project, such as openstreetmap.org. If you have a good reason to create a site that uses OSM's look and feel, please contact the OSMF at legal@osmfoundation.org.

### 5.2. Linking to non-OSMF sites
You may use the OSM marks to link only to OSM projects. Please refer to Section 3.4.4 if you want to link to an OSM project from your website.

### 5.3. Misrepresentation
When you use an OSM mark, do not create the impression that your use is in any way endorsed, or sponsored by, or part of the OSMF.

### 5.4. Registration in other jurisdictions
You may not register the OSM marks in national registries of intellectual property, such as a trademark register. The OSM marks are used and recognized globally in connection with the services offered by the OSMF, and cannot be registered or otherwise claimed by you or other third-parties. If you are a community member who lives in a jurisdiction, and would like to see an OSM mark protected in your jurisdiction, please contact legal@osmfoundation.org.

### 5.5. Use in company names
You may not use the OSM marks as part of a company name.

## 6. Trademark abuse

### 6.1. Reporting abuse
Fighting trademark abuse is very important. OSMF puts a lot of effort into going after cases of trademark infringement, in order to protect the valuable trademark rights the OSM community has created. If you see a mark being used in any way that could be infringing, please tell us! Just send an email to the OSMF at legal@osmfoundation.org. We appreciate your help!

### 6.2. Revoking permission for abusive uses 
OSMF may revoke the right to use the OSM marks under this policy at any time if it determines that a trademark use is inconsistent with OSM's mission, or could otherwise harm community members, OSM, OSMF, or the project's goodwill.

## 7. Revision of the trademark policy

This trademark policy can be revised under the following circumstances:
* For significant changes, OSMF will give at least 30 days notice, and opportunity to comment, on the OSM projects and in an email to `[QQQ: relevant community mailing list?]`.
* For minor changes or changes required by law, when possible OSMF will provide three days’ notice to `[QQQ: relevant community mailing list?]`.  Minor changes include language fixes, administrative changes, or corrections of inaccurate statements.
* For changes to the user-friendly summary, the purpose statement, the FAQs, the trademark request form, and the violation reporting form, OSMF can make changes without notice.

## 8. Questions
Please don't hesitate to contact OSMF at legal@osmfoundation.org if you are not sure whether your use is in compliance with this policy or local trademark laws.
