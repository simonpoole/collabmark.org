# OSM Trademark FAQ

## What can I do with domains or company names containing "OpenStreetMap" and other OSM marks?
Domain and company names registered in good faith before January 1st, 2013, will be licensed to the original registrant on request. The license will require that the domain be transferred to the OSMF or de-registered if any of the following events occur:

* no longer in use for OpenStreetMap related services, products or similar;
* change of control events (sale, mergers etc);
* bankruptcy, dissolution, or similar corporate events; or
* death of an individual non-corporate licensee

Alternately, on a case-by-case basis, the OSMF may determine that it is necessary to avoid such issues by having such marks or names transferred to the OSMF and to licensing them back to the registrant. In such a case the OSMF will carry all costs of the transfer.

## What can I do with domains or company names using remixes of "OpenStreetMap" and other OSM marks?

We intend to apply the same policy and licensing requirements as outlined above for use of remixes of the marks, for example "OpenThingMap". We will however consider licensing such use for registrations up to the publishing date of the Trademark Policy.

## Do I need to add a trademark notice additionally to adding attribution

We do not require a trademark disclaimer in addition to providing attribution as long as the use is non-confusing, if you use the OSM marks outside of just attribution you do need to provide a notice as suggested in 2.2.
